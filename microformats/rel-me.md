# rel-me microformat

The [rel-me microformat][1] allows one to add hyperlinks from one site to

[Simon Willson][2]'s TIL [Verifying your GitHub profile on Mastodon][3]
describes a clever means by which to overcome Mastodon / GitHub limitations
relating to identity verification by utilizing a GitHub-pages site as an
intermediate hop.
